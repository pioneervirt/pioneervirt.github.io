# T-Augers
## Learn about the drills used in pioneer days.

T-augers are the predecessors of modern electric drills and jackhammers. A T-auger is comprised of an auger bit (a long, screw-shaped piece of metal often with a sharp tip) and a handle, forming the shape from which the T-auger draws its name. The devices, whose sizes and widths range from those of large drills to modern jackhammers, rose to popularity through the 1897 issue of the Millers Falls Companyâ€™s catalog. Most of the T-augurs on display were likely produced after during 1897 and closely subsequent years.

Though portable and relatively inexpensive to produce, T-augers had drawbacks. Chiefly, the user had to reposition his hands at least twice during a full rotation of the tool, making the process of using the tool to bore holes slow and tedious. This flaw would later lead to the creation of bit braces and eventually power tools.
